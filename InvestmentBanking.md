> **What is Investment Banking**

> * Investment banking is a banking process, wherein a bank manages and assists a company in its financial dealings, and after analysis,
> suggests different measures to maximize profit.
> * Public companies are companies that give out shares for the public to invest in. This handing out of shares is called Initial Public
> Offering(IPO).

>  **How Investment Banks work** 

> * Investment banks buy most/all shares of a company that plans to go public for a price, say x.
> * It then sells out the shares to the public at a higher price. 
> * The risk here is, if the company shares are overvalued, that is, if the investment bank charges prices much higher than what people are  ready to invest, the investment bank will be into losses.
> * The job of the investment bankers, is to analyse the company and its stocks, and estimate the price the shares need to be put at, to 
> to maximize the profit.
> * Investment banks compete among one another to get a contract of IPO with companies. The contract goes out to the IB that offers the 
> largest sum for the IPO. 

>  **How do companies benefit** 

> * One might wonder, if all the investment bank does, is buy at lower and sell at higher prices, why does 
> the company itself not sell its shares at the higher price. 
> * The answer is market analysis. The investment banks have gained enough security and stronghold in the market, as well as have financial 
> backing, to sell the shares at the time it would be most profitable to.
> * If a new company enters the market to sell a million shares, people will tend to be suspicious about its success, and not prefer buying
> it.
> * Thus, the companies get immediate capital from the investment banks, and the banks get profit from the company's success.

> **Other roles of investment banks:** 

> * Most IBs deal with very large corporates and governments to manage projects' finances, which might
> otherwise be a gruesome task.
> * IBs also facilitate mergers, acquisitions and sales. IBs advice their client companies as to how best to structure a deal to associate  with another company.
